Just a little note about what this project is:  basically, this is a simple html and CSS intro course learning the basics, with the end result building 
an example of the YouTube homepage.

A few things specifically I learnt:

      - Display: understanding block/inline block, and how each of these are displayed in the browser
      - Grid (see intro-to-html/grid.html): 'display: grid'. A fairly rigid way of defining a grid within a website
      - Flexbox (see intro-to-html/flexbox.html): 'display: flex'.  A more flexible way of defining a layout within a website.
      - Position (see intro-to-html/position.html): 'position: fixed/absolute/relative etc'.   
      - Responsive: media queries and setting different views according to screen size.
      
These techniques were then applied and the index.html was created (a good replica of the youtube.com website!) using vanilla html and CSS.  

Had good fun with this.  I actually enjoyed CSS more than I thought I would!
